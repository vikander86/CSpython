# Terminal Game Project

## Who wants to be a millonaire?

What needs to be done?

* User has to go through 15 questions, ranking in difficulty.
* Include 1-2 different topics (gaming or tv series maybe?)
* User gets 3 lifelines:
  * 50/50
  * Extra chance
  * Get a hint?
* User can reach checkpoints and if user ends prematurely, give reward at checkpoint, show next question.
* Congratulate user on winnings, and pity if the they have no winnings :P
* Ask user if user wants to play again.
